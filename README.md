- 👋 Hi, I’m @baker-ling. My real name is Brian Baker. I am a linguist (historical/Japanese), turned translator/interpreter, turned software developer.
- 👀 I’m interested in soccer, human language, tea, coffee, Mexican food, and machine learning.
- 🌱 I　just finished a 6-month part-time full stack web development with JavaScript. Now, I'd like to learn TypeScript, to learn about making mobile apps with Flutter or React Native, or to brush up on machine learning / NLP with Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a web or mobile app, a machine learning or NLP project, or anything Japan or Japanese related.
