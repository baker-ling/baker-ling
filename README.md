- 👋 Hi, I’m @baker-ling. My real name is Brian Baker. I am a linguist (historical/Japanese), turned translator/interpreter, turned software developer.
- 👀 I’m interested in soccer, human language, tea, coffee, Mexican food, and machine learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying full stack web development with JavaScript as part of a bootcamp program. After that, I'd like to learn how to make mobile apps with Flutter or React Native or brush up on machine learning / NLP with Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a web or mobile app, a machine learning or NLP project, or anything Japan or Japanese related.
